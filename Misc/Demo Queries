- What are the top 5 products by revenue in Q1 2024?

- Analyze customer satisfaction across all products and identify which ones need improvement

- Compare our support ticket patterns with customer satisfaction scores to identify problem products



Most Complex:

Conduct a comprehensive operational analysis to identify efficiency improvements and optimize resource allocation across our customer-facing teams. Provide:

Support Operations Analysis:

Calculate key support metrics (first response time, resolution time, CSAT) by product, priority, and agent
Identify bottlenecks causing delays and escalations
Analyze correlation between ticket volume and product issues reported in surveys
Determine if support capacity matches product adoption patterns from sales data
Calculate cost per ticket and identify opportunities for self-service


Product-Market Fit Assessment:

Map support ticket categories to feature ratings and pain points in survey data
Identify products with low satisfaction but high support burden
Analyze if marketing promises (from web analytics) align with product reality (from support tickets)
Determine which products need improvement vs. better customer education
Calculate the "friction index" - ratio of support burden to revenue generated


Team Performance & Workload Optimization:

Analyze employee performance ratings against their workload and product assignments
Identify if high-performing support agents handle easier or harder tickets
Assess if team satisfaction scores correlate with product quality issues
Determine optimal team size and skill distribution based on ticket patterns
Identify training needs based on common unresolved issues


Customer Journey Optimization:

Trace customer path from website acquisition to support interaction
Identify where customers face friction (high bounce rates, many support tickets, low satisfaction)
Analyze if trial-to-paid conversion issues relate to specific product problems
Map the relationship between marketing expectations and actual product experience


Resource Reallocation Plan:

Recommend engineering resources to fix high-impact issues
Suggest support team restructuring based on product and skill gaps
Propose customer success initiatives to reduce support burden
Recommend documentation and self-service improvements
Calculate expected efficiency gains and cost savings
Provide implementation priorities based on impact vs. effort
